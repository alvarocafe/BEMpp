# BEMpp
These are explorations on the BEMpp platform. It consists mainly of Jupyter notebooks. 

## Instalation
These are BEMpp notebooks, I assume its running through the docker created kernel. 
For more information on BEMpp, visit bempp.com
For installation using docker to open these notebooks, visit https://bempp.com/download/docker/
To use the notebooks, clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/alvarocafe/BEMpp
Now open the notebooks through docker and that's it!

### Interface with FreeCAD and Gmsh

One of the goals of this exploration is to improve the interface between FreeCAD, Gmsh and BEMpp. 
This will facilitate the use of BEMpp to solve engineering driven problems that have complex geometries.
